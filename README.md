## [Self](selflanguage.org/) on top of [GraalVM](http://graalvm.org)

This is my attempt to implement as trivial language as possible via **Truffle**.
After a bit of research I decided to implement [Self](selflanguage.org/).
There are at least three reasons for doing that:

When I was visiting the Smalltalk course at Charles University in 
the middle of nineteen nineties we dedicated one hour to something _simpler_
than Smalltalk called [Self](selflanguage.org/). Smalltalk itself was quite
simple. Yet, surprisingly to us, the [Self](selflanguage.org/) language 
really is simpler. The _simplicity_ is one reason for trying to
re-implement it.

The other thing I learned in the course was that we don't have hardware
to run [Self](selflanguage.org/). A computer with 32MB of memory and SunOS
was needed and we had just poor Pentiums with at most four megabytes hardly running
Linux and X11. As a result I have not yet written and executed a single 
[Self](selflanguage.org/) program yet. Re-implementing the language is a nice
opportunity to do so!

Last, but definitely not least. There would be no Java, no [GraalVM](http://graalvm.org)
without the [Self](selflanguage.org/) language. Re-implementing the language 
is a way to pay back to this great pioneer of dynamic compilation.

Join me celebrating [Self](selflanguage.org/) by forking this repository.
